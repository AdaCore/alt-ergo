.SH DESCRIPTION

.B Alt-Ergo
is an automatic theorem prover.  It takes as inputs an arbitrary
polymorphic and multi-sorted first-order formula written is the Why's
syntax.

.TP
A theory of functional arrays with integer indexes . This theory
provides a built-in type ('a,'b) farray and a built-in syntax for
manipulating arrays.

For instance, given an abstract datatype tau and a functional array t
of type (int, tau) farray declared as follows:

type tau

logic t : (int, tau) farray

The expressions:

t[i] denotes the value stored in t at index i

t[i1<-v1,...,in<-vn] denotes an array which stores the same values as
t for every index except possibly i1,...,in, where it stores value
v1,...,vn. This expression is equivalent to ((t[i1<-v1])[i2<-v2])...[in<-vn].


Examples.

t[0<-v][1<-w]

t[0<-v, 1<-w]

t[0<-v, 1<-w][1]


.TP
A theory of enumeration types.

For instance an enumeration type t with constructors A, B, C is
defined as follows :

type t = A | B | C

Which means that all values of type t are equal to either A, B or
C. And that all these constructors are distinct.


.TP
A theory of polymorphic records.

For instance a polymorphic record type 'a t with two labels a and b of
type 'a and int respectively is defined as follows:

type 'a t = { a : 'a; b : int }

The expressions { a = 4; b = 5 } and { r with b = 3} denote records,
while the dot notation r.a is used to access to labels.
