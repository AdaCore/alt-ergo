module DE = Dolmen.Std.Expr

(** The purpose of this module is to construct a total order on ADT
    constructors to ensure the termination of model generation for
    this theory.

    By nest, we mean the set of all the constructors in a mutually
    recursive definition of ADTs.

    Before comparing constructors with [compare], the complete
    nest to which they belong have to be added with [add_nest]. *)

type t = DE.ty_def list
(** Type of nest. *)

val add_nest : t -> unit
(** [add_nest defs] sorts and adds the nest [defs] in the current
    internal order.

    {b Note:} Assume that [defs] is a complete nest (in any order). *)

val compare : Uid.t -> Uid.t -> int
(** [compare id1 id2] compares the constructors [id1] and [id2] with
    the order generated by [add_nest] if they are both Dolmen identifiers.

    @raise Failure if the nests of the constructors [id1] and [id2] have not
                   been added with [add_nest] before. *)

val reinit : unit -> unit
(** [reinit ()] clears all the registered constructors by [add_nest]. *)
