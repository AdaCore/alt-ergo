version 0.99.1, December 30, 2014
=================================
  o the "SAT solving" part can now be delegated to an external plugin;

  o new experimental SAT solver based on mini-SAT, provided as a
  plugin. This solver is, in general, more efficient on ground
  problems;

  o heuristics simplification in the default SAT solver and in the
  matching (instantiation) module;

  o re-implementation of internal literals representation;

  o improvement of theories combination architecture;

  o rewriting some parts of the formulas module;

  o bugfixes in records and numbers modules;

  o new option "-no-Ematching" to perform matching without equality
  reasoning (i.e. without considering "equivalence classes"). This
  option is very useful for benchmarks coming from Atelier-B;

  o two new experimental options: "-save-used-context" and
  "-replay-used-context". When the goal is proved valid, the first option
  allows to save the names of useful axioms into a ".used" file. The
  second one is used to replay the proof using only the axioms listed
  in the corresponding ".used" file. Note that the replay may fail
  because of the absence of necessary ground terms generated by
  useless axioms (that are not included in .used file) during the
  initial run.

version 0.95.2, September 20th, 2013
====================================

  o Alt-Ergo is now maintained and distributed by OCamlPro, while
    academic research is conducted in partnership with the VALS team
    (LRI),

  o quantifiers instantiation heuristics are simplified,

=================================

  o bug fixes (existantial elimination, Euclidean division)

=================================

  + Main changes in the solver:
  -----------------------------

    o new combination method for Shostak solvers

    o input language extension: polymorphic declaration are now allowed (logic x: 'a)

    o input language extension: the types of terms can now be forced in a formula using the construct <term> : <type> (see man for an example)

    o input language modification: a label should be a string. The construct <label> : <term> is replaced by "<label>" : <term>

    o new keywords in the syntax: inversion, check, cut and include

    o experimental options for theories models generation:
        -model option: model on labeled terms
        -complete-model option: complete model
