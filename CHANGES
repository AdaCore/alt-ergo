version 1.30, November 21, 2016
==============================

* experimental support for models generation (for more details, see
   http://www.ocamlpro.com/2016/11/21/release-of-alt-ergo-1-30-with-experimental-support-for-models-generation/).

* simplify formulas of the form "forall x : t. x <> t or F" when t
  does not contain x. The only relevant instance in this case is
  "(x <> t or F) {x |-> t}". In a similar way, this allows to simplify
  formulas of the form "exists x : t. x = t and F" to "F {x |-> t}".

* integration of general simplex in IntervalCalculus based on
  ocplib-simplex.

* important parts of Intervals and IntervalCalculus have been
  rewritten and improved.

* improve tightening of intervals for non-linear variables, and of the
  CP-like loop.

* extend Fourier-Motzkin to deduce more bounds based on relational
  dependencies of the form "c * x <= (Sum_i d_i * y_i) + e"

* various improvements in the default SAT solver, Term, Formula,
  IntervalCalculus, Matching, Numbers, case-split, ...

* various (soundness and/or completeness) bug fixes in Uf, Intervals,
  IntervalCalculus, Theory, Formula, type-checking, Triggers,
  fm-simplex and satML, ...

* new option "-inst-after-bj" that forces an instantiation round after
  each backtracking/backjumping in the default SAT solver.

* new option "-no-backjumping" that disables backjumping in the
  default SAT solver (for debugging).

* new option "-fm-cross-limit" that controls the number of
  intermediate inequalities produces by Fourier-Motzking. Default
  value is 10,000.

* new option "-no-ac" to be able to deactivate the AC theory

* new option "-no-NLA" that disables non-linear arithmetic reasoning
   (*, /, %). Non-linear multiplication remains AC.


version 1.20, February 09, 2016
==============================

* default value of option -age-bound increased from 10 to 50

* bugfix when using option --all-models

* improvements in Matching: a set of instances may cause more than one
  conflict. It's better to detect the more precise one

* remove case-split limit for the theory of arrays

* bugfix in the profiler plugin

* improvements in the default SAT solver


version 1.10, October 19, 2015
==============================

* Improvements and bug fixes in the satML plugin

* Improvement of the solver of linear arithmetic in presence of
  non-linear arithmetic parts in the equations to be solved

* Many improvements in case-split analysis. In particular, this is now
  performed by explicit calls from the SAT solver. Its behavior can be
  controlled with the new option "-case-split-policy". Possible values
  for this option are: "after-theory-assume" (default),
  "before-matching", and "after-matching".

* Alt-Ergo can now be called on zipped files (eg. <file>.mlw.zip or
  <file>.why.zip). Decompression is done on the fly with camlzip.

* Soundness bug fixes in arithmetic, interval calculus, union-find,
  ...

* Code reviewing/refactoring/rewriting/optimization in many parts of
  the solver


version 1.00, January 29, 2015
==============================

* General Improvements:

   ** theories data structures: semantic values (internal theories
      representation of terms) are now hash-consed. This enables the
      use of hash-based comparison (instead of structural comparison)
      when possible

   ** theories combination: the dispatcher component, that sends
      literals assumed by the SAT solver to different theories
      depending on whether these literals are equalities,
      disequalities or inequalities, has been re-implemented. The new
      code is much simpler and enables new optimizations and
      factorizations

   ** case-split analysis: we made several improvements in the
      heuristics of the case-split analysis mechanism over finite
      domains

   ** explanations propagation: we improved explanations propagation
      in congruence closure and linear arithmetic algorithms. This
      makes the proofs faster thanks to a better back-jumping in the
      SAT solver part

   ** linear integer arithmetic: we re-implemented several parts of
      linear arithmetic and introduced important improvements in the
      Fourier-Motzkin algorithm to make it run on smaller sub-problems
      avoiding some redundant executions. These optimizations allowed
      a significant speed up on our internal benchmarks

   ** data structures: we optimized hash-consing and some functions in
      the "formula" and "literal" modules

   ** SAT solving: we made a lot of improvements to the default
       SAT-solver and to the SatML plugin. In particular, the decision
       procedure part now receives facts (literals) in bulk from the
       solvers, rather than individually, trimming the costs of
       intermediate calls to theories reasoners, such as
       Fourier-Motzkin

   ** Matching: we extended the E-matching algorithm to also perform
      matching modulo the theory of records. In addition, we
      simplified matching heuristics and optimized the E-matching
      process to avoid computing the same instances several times

   ** Memory management: thanks to the ocp-memprof tool
      (http://memprof.typerex.org/), we identified some parts of
      Alt-Ergo that needed some improvements in order to avoid useless
      memory allocations, and thus unburden the OCaml garbage
      collector

   ** the function that retrieves the used axioms and predicates (when
      option 'save-used-context' is set) has been improved


* Bug Fixes:

   ** 6 in the "inequalities" module of linear arithmetic

   ** 4 in the "formula" module

   ** 3 in the "ty" module used for types representation and
      manipulation

   ** 2 in the "theories front-end" module that interacts with the
      SAT solvers

   ** 1 in the "congruence closure" algorithm

   ** 1 in "existential quantifiers elimination" module

   ** 1 in the "type-checker"

   ** 1 in the "AC theory" of associative and commutative function
      symbols

   ** 1 in the "union-find" module


* New OCamlPro Plugins:

  ** profiling plugin: when activated, this plugin records and prints
    some information about the current execution of Alt-Ergo every 'n'
    seconds: In particular, one can observe a module being activated,
    a function being called, the amount of time spent in every
    module/function, the current decision/instantiation level, the
    number of decisions/instantiations that have been made so far, the
    number of case-splits, of boolean/theory conflicts, of assumptions
    in the decision procedure, of generated instances per axiom, ...

  ** fm-simplex plugin: when activated, this plugin is used instead of
    the Fourier-Motzkin method to infer bounds for linear integer
    arithmetic affine forms (which are used in the case-split analysis
    process). This module uses the Simplex algorithm to simulate
    particular runs of Fourier-Motzkin. In practice, the new algorithm
    scales better on linear integer arithmetic problems containing
    lots of inequalities


* New Options:

  -version-info: prints some information about this version of
   Alt-Ergo (release and compilation dates, release commit ID)

  -no-theory: deactivate theory reasoning. In this case, only the
   SAT-solver and the matching parts are used

  -inequalities-plugin: specify a plugin to use, instead of the
  "default" Fourier-Motzkin algorithm, to handle inequalities of
  linear arithmetic

  -tighten-vars: when this option is set, the Fm-Simplex plugin will
   try to infer bounds for integer variables as well. Note that this
   option may be very expensive

  -profiling-plugin: specify a profiling plugin to use to monitor an
   execution of Alt-Ergo

  -profiling <delay>: makes the profiling module prints its information
   every <delay> seconds

  -no-tcp: deactivate constraints propagation modulo theories


* Removed Capabilities:

  ** the pruning module used in the frontend is not available anymore

  ** the SMT and SMT2 front-ends have been removed. We plan to implement a
     new front-end for SMT2 in upcoming releases


version 0.99.1, December 30, 2014
=================================
  o the "SAT solving" part can now be delegated to an external plugin;

  o new experimental SAT solver based on mini-SAT, provided as a
  plugin. This solver is, in general, more efficient on ground
  problems;

  o heuristics simplification in the default SAT solver and in the
  matching (instantiation) module;

  o re-implementation of internal literals representation;

  o improvement of theories combination architecture;

  o rewriting some parts of the formulas module;

  o bugfixes in records and numbers modules;

  o new option "-no-Ematching" to perform matching without equality
  reasoning (i.e. without considering "equivalence classes"). This
  option is very useful for benchmarks coming from Atelier-B;

  o two new experimental options: "-save-used-context" and
  "-replay-used-context". When the goal is proved valid, the first option
  allows to save the names of useful axioms into a ".used" file. The
  second one is used to replay the proof using only the axioms listed
  in the corresponding ".used" file. Note that the replay may fail
  because of the absence of necessary ground terms generated by
  useless axioms (that are not included in .used file) during the
  initial run.
