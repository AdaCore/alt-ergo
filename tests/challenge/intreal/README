Hi,
    some simple goals on conversion between ints and reals
     which take time to be proved :

intreal-IntReal-G1.why proved by Altergo 0.05s (40) CVC3 and Z3
intreal-IntReal-G2.why proved by Altergo 1.4s (113)
intreal-IntReal-G3.why proved by Altergo 1.8s (115)
intreal-IntReal-G4.why proved by Altergo 8.3s (291)
intreal-IntReal-G5.why proved by Altergo 10.4s (291)

The challenge is to reduce the time taken by alt-ergo.
Notice that some commits ago it takes 2.7s for alt-ergo to prove
each goal except the first.

Questions:
- from_int must be easily built-in, but floor?, ceil?,...
- Is it linked with Gappa in Alt-ergo?

Cheers,
